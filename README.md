# A-Digital-Survey-on-the-Acceptance-Affordability-and-Willingness-to-take-COVID-19-Vaccine

The rising number of Covid Positive cases has been one of the major concerns in the country. Reducing and controlling the number of Covid cases in India has become the need of the hour. The Indian Medical Research Institutes have successfully designed Covaxin and Covishied vaccines. But it has been observed that a lot of vaccines manufactured are wasted because the vaccines are not easily available at adorable prices to the public. Also, many rumors and misinformation regarding the side effects of Vaccines have been spread among the public. Hence, this survey was conducted to estimate the number of people who are willing to take vaccines at a certain locality, so that the number of vaccines for the locality can be manufactured accordingly and the wastage of vaccines can be reduced.
